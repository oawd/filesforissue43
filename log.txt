
Processing the PDF with pdfCropMargins (version 1.0.9)...
Python version: ('3', '10', '5')
System type: Windows

The input document's filename is:
    C:\Users\useraccount\Downloads\pdf\dummy.pdf

The output document's filename will be:
    C:\Users\useraccount\Downloads\pdf\output.pdf

The absolute pre-crops to be applied to each margin, in units of bp, are:
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

The percentages of margins to retain are:
    [10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0]

The absolute offsets to be applied to each margin, in units of bp, are:
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

The uniform order statistics to apply to each margin, in units of bp, are:
    []

For the full page size, using values from the PDF box
specified by the intersection of these boxes: ['m', 'c']

The input document has 1 pages.

The document's metadata, if set:

   The Author attribute set in the input document is:
      Evangelos Vlachogiannis
   The Creator attribute set in the input document is:
      Writer
   The Producer attribute set in the input document is:
      OpenOffice.org 2.1
   The Subject attribute set in the input document is:
      None
   The Title attribute set in the input document is:
      None

All the pages of the document will be cropped.

Original full page sizes, in PDF format (lbrt):
	1   rot = 0 	 [0, 0, 595, 842]

Copied these items from the document catalog:
   /Type /Outlines
Skipped copy of these items from the document catalog:
   /Pages

The document was not previously cropped by pdfCropMargins.

Writing out the PDF with the CropBox and MediaBox redefined.

Rendering the PDF to images using the mupdf program,
this may take a while...

Analyzing the page images with Pillow to find bounding boxes,
using the threshold 191.  Finding the bounding box for page:

1 

The bounding boxes are:
	 1 	 [58.0, 754.0, 180.0, 770.0]

Setting each page size to the smallest box bounding all the pages.

All the selected pages will be uniformly cropped.

The smallest delta values actually used to set the uniform cropping
amounts (ignoring any '-m' skips and pages in ranges not cropped) were
found on these pages, numbered from 1:
    [1, 1, 1, 1]

The final delta values themselves are:
    [52.2, 678.6, 373.5, 64.8]

New full page sizes after cropping, in PDF format (lbrt):
	1	 [52.2000000000000028421709430404007434844970703125, 678.6000000000000227373675443232059478759765625, 221.5, 777.200000000000045474735088646411895751953125]

Writing the cropped PDF file.

Finished this run of pdfCropMargins.
